## Getting Started
Here is how you can set up and start learning. Tested with *python 3.9.7*.

1. Begin by cloning the repository


```shell
git clone https://www.github.com/ASingaporean/AS-populationTransferAnalysis
cd AS-populationTransferAnalysis
```

2. You could (Optionally) create a python environment. Here are the instructions using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)

```shell
pyenv install 3.9.7
pyenv local 3.9.7
pyenv virtualenv AS-populationTransferAnalysis
pyenv local AS-populationTransferAnalysis
```

3. To Install dependencies

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Once you have done all of the above, you can start [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/) and experiment with the notebooks in `notebooks` folder:

```shell
jupyterlab
```
Enjoy the journey into Quantum Technologies.
